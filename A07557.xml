            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>He then that will put on this new man, muſt firſt cloath his vnderſtanding with knowledge, which

               <p>But what Saints? Such, for the moſt part, that haue bene canonized, not by God, but by Popes.

               <p>But leauing them to their beads, I will turne my pen to maintaine the praiers of the faithfull man: whoſe prayers <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſaith, <hi>are vaine, becauſe hee is aſſured of his ſaluation.</hi> Will <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſay that S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> (the beloued Deſciple of the Lord, that leaned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his breaſt, vnto whom he bequeathed in his laſt will his mother, a virgin to a virgin) was not aſſured of his ſaluation? If he ſay hee was not, the teſtimony of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> will confute him, wherein it is written:<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>We know that we are tranſlated from death to life.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6.12.</note> not that the puniſhment due to ſin was not forgiuen them, for then Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would not haue ſaid: <hi>We know that we are tranſlated from death to life.</hi> But that through the increaſe of faith they might more and more inwardly feele the application of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13969:49"/> the forgiueneſſe of ſins.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15 17. Phil. 3.13</note> who proueth by the reſurrection of Chriſt, the actuall remiſſion of ſinnes: which could not be; <hi>If Chriſt be not raiſed</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>your faith is in vaine, and ye are yet in your ſinnes.</hi> Afterward ſaith: <hi>I count not my ſelfe that I haue attained vnto it</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the 9. and 10. verſes before) <hi>to the full knowledge of Chriſt, and perfect taſte of his reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if an Apoſtle (wrapped vp in the third heauen, a pen man of the holy Ghoſt) could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to a full and perfect taſt of his ſaluation: how much leſſe thoſe whoſe faith is but as a graine of muſtard ſeede, yet ſufficient to ſaluation, attaine to the full taſte of the application of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, without much praier? The man that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Chriſt, deſired of him <hi>to helpe his vnbeliefe</hi> and many a poore ſoules conſcience caſt downe: yet the children of God would be glad to pray day and night; to finde but one dram of this application that Popiſh Prieſts will not weare their hoſe out in the knees for.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Tim. Eph.

               <p>Then here is another notable motiue to ſtirre vp a faithfull man to praier, that hee may earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire with Saint <hi>Paul: that God would make perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

That his memory ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, may retaine euermore good and holy cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, and of commendable actions, whereby religion is preſerued and increaſed. That he would purifie his affections, and in ſtead of ſuch as are euill and corrupt, excite (by his holy ſpirit, working in his word) honeſt and vertuous motions in his heart. And that the inferour powers may be obedient to the ſuperiour: that the image of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by repaired, and the image of Satan aboliſhed, we may bee wholly gouerned, through the effectuall working, and the plentifull preſence of Gods Spirit.</p>
               <p>For as yet in this life, the faithfull man hath the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, and not the tenth: ſo that the fleſh liueth ſtill in a manner fully in him. The which aduantage Sathan eſpying, by beholding grace begun and not perfected, fighteth againſt the beginning, fearing leſt by the growth of grace they ſhould come to perfection.</p>
               <p>Shall not then a faithfull man that aimeth at holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, (that excellent garland of glory, reſiſt Satan by prayer? ſeeing neceſſity requireth it, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour commands it,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.41</note> ſaying: <hi>Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation:</hi> that is, leſt you be ouercome of temptation: <hi>the ſpirit is ready, but the fleſh is weake:</hi> the Spirit is ready to worke a new creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vs, that we may be prepared as a Bride to meete our Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, yet the fleſh is weake to yeeld, but ſtrong to reſiſt.</p>

Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13969:53"/> ſaith no: The Councell of <hi>Toletane</hi> the 12. holden in <hi>Spaine,</hi> made conſtitution, both againſt <hi>images,</hi> and the <hi>worſhip</hi> of <hi>images.</hi> The Councell of <hi>Elibertine,</hi> likewiſe holden in <hi>Spaine,</hi> decreed that all pictures ſhould bee had out of Churches, and that nothing which is honored and worſhipped, ſhould be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Church walles.</p>
               <p>Heere were godly decrees to remoue Images, whereas they haue remoued the ſecond Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement out of the firſt table, to maintaine images, and diuided the laſt Commandement into two, to make vp ten, though not able to ſay which is the ninth or tenth: For that which is firſt in <hi>Exodus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 20.17. Deut. 5.21</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thus it appeareth that they that would ſeeme to adore Chriſt as a Redeemer, rob and diſpoyle him of his honourable title, in ſtilling others their Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, in canonizing Saints for interceſſors in his ſtead, by calling images after his name, and by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping them with the ſame honour.</p>
               <p>Now it remaineth to cleare the Proteſtants of that falſe imputation, which is, that they ſhould rob and diſpoyle <hi>Chriſt of that honourable title of Redeemer.</hi> But wherein? <hi>In denying Saints to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that we acknowledge Chriſt, and not the Saints to bee the ſupreme and onely aduocate: we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a truth, to the prouing that we are not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of a latter brood. And to begin withall, wee know and hold it for granted, that in the beginning
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13969:54"/> no Saint could be prayed vnto. For what Saint was there for <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Abel</hi> to pray vnto? or by whoſe helpe or power entred the firſt Saint into heauen? ſay not by interceſſion of Saints, for then there was none in heauen: nor by their owne power, for then <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed in vaine.</p>
               <p>And is not Chriſt now as powerful as before, that we need the helpe of Saints? no doubt he is. What Saint did <hi>Ambraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Moſes, Dauid Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> pray to? we haue examples in Scripture, that all prayed to God.</p>
               <p>And hath the Church of Rome found out a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way then the Prophets and Apoſtles knew of, or Chriſt himſelfe hath euer reuealed? That hath taught vs to <hi>pray to his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince they haue found out a ſafer way, let them in their wiſdome ſhew vs likewiſe: firſt the time when we muſt pray to the Saints? the Annotations vpon the Rhems ſaith: <hi>That we cannot pray to our bleſſed Lady nor any Saint in heauen,</hi>

And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all before they pray vnto them, by beleeuing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vpon them, contrary to Chriſt precept: <hi>Beleeue in me, and you ſhall be ſaued:</hi> not in the merits of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> S. <hi>Clare,</hi> and ſuch like. <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus,</hi> cited by D. <hi>Fulke,</hi> ſaith: <hi>We ought of right to beleeue both</hi> Paul <hi>&amp;</hi> Peter:<note place="margin">Rhem 471.</note> 
                  <hi>but to beleeue in</hi> Peter <hi>&amp;</hi> Paul, <hi>that is, to bestow vpon the ſeruants the honour of the Lord, which we ought not. Ruffinus</hi> vpon the Creed hath
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13969:54"/> obſerued, that the propoſition <hi>In,</hi> is not added where the ſpeech is not of the God-head, but of creatures and myſteries. As for example: <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in God the Father, in Ieſus Chriſt, in the holy Ghoſt: The holy Catholicke Church, not in the holy Catholicke Church; The forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, not in the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. Reſurrection of the fleſh, not in the reſurrection of the fleſh.</hi> Therefore to beleeue in Saints is iniurious to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the place where we muſt pray to them,<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. annot.</note> the Annotations vpon the Rhems ſaith: <hi>Where they are preſent, the Catholicke men reſort to pray to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that is, to their tombes and reliques: for the Saints are preſent at their tombes and reliques</hi> (ſaith the Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)</p>
               <p>But we muſt vnderſtand that they are preſent with their dead bodies, if their preſence be at all. <hi>For their ſoules,</hi> (ſaith the Annotation) <hi>liue vnder Chriſt, their Altar in heauen expecting their bodyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if we will needes pray to them, wee muſt pray to them as they are preſent: namely to the dead bodies ſeparated from their ſoules.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how the dead bodies of Saints, in whoſe preſence they pray, come to the knowledge of our praiers? for other preſence they can proue none.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Seeing then they come to the notion of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by ſeeing God face to face, it reſteth they proue how the dead bodies can ſee God face to face, in whoſe preſence they pray.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:13969:55"/>
               <p>But ſay that their ſoules did attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our prayers from God, what neceſſity is there in it, that they needing themſelues a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mediator to ſtand in the preſence of God, ſhould acquaint God, as ſecond mediatours, with that hee knew before to the breeding of a confuſion in that celeſtiall Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>If their ſoules did know when wee prayed vnto them, yet would it nothing profite; becauſe, not knowing whether our prayers were in faith or no, (which is a thing peculiar to God) they could not tell, when to offer, or not to offer them for feare of the Lords diſpleaſure, who hath threatned <hi>euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting deſtruction to the fauourits of his enemies.</hi>

For the worſhip of God, and exerciſe in religion (which ſacrifice in the Maſſe ſo offered) is a moſt pleaſing and cleane ſacrifice; not onely in respect of the outward forme, which is vnbloudy, but alſo in respect of the moſt chaſt, pure, and virgin like fleſh and bloud of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then ſeeing Chriſts ſacrifice, (as the Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vpon the Rhems teacheth) conſiſteth in the perpetuall ſacrifice of his body and bloud in the Church. Then it conſiſteth not in that ſacrifice <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſon</hi> ſpeaketh of: becauſe it is vnbloudy, without bloud: therefore without profite. <hi>For without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloud is no remiſſion.</hi>

               <p>But ſeeing a ſacrifice offered by an vnder Prieſt, is ſo powerfull to vphold religion, and the worſhip of God, which the ſacrifice of Chriſt cannot. Let vs behold this ſacrifice ſo highly commended, and ſo maieſtically offered by virgin-like Prieſts. And firſt the excellency of the Prieſts that maketh and offereth it.

               <p>As the vnder Prieſt is before God in the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo hee is in the place of God in the offering.

               <p>As the vnder Prieſt is in the place of God in the offering: ſo he is before Chriſt in the offering.

               </p>
               <p>As the vnder Prieſt is excellent in his conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and offering: ſo he is in his mediatorſhip.

               <p>As the vnder Prieſt is a mediator, to intreate God: to accept the ſacrifice of his Sonne.

               </p>
               <p>So the vnder Prieſt, with the king of pride, in the remiſſion of ſinnes, would communicate to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that which is proper to the Diuinity. For no man can remit ſinnes but God onely. Therefore he which remitteth ſinnes is God: becauſe no man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth ſinnes but God. And thus the vnder Prieſt in the Maſſe, taketh vpon him to be as a God, when he ſaith: <hi>Et ego, authoritate mihi conceſſa, &amp;c. And I by my authority do first abſolue thee, from the ſentence of the leſſe excommunication, if thou haue need thereof. And beſides I abſolue thee from all thy ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the excellency of the vnder Prieſt, who is the maker, the offerer, and the mediatour of this excellent ſacrifice: that is offered to vphold religion, and the worſhip of God: which Chriſts ſacrifice cannot do.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:13969:60"/>
               <p>Secondly, it is neceſſary to know: who it is that can make a round cake a God by conſecration, able to performe this. The Maiſter of the Sentences ſaith. <hi>That an hereticke cannot conſecrate.</hi> Moreouer, <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer bewrayeth himſelfe, to be of the latter ſtanding, is an heretique:</hi> (by <hi>Kelliſons</hi> cenſure) which all popiſh Prieſtes do, in offering vp bread vnconſecrate, for the remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>In the firſt part of the Canon, which beginneth with <hi>Te igitur,</hi> the bread vnconſecrated (yet <hi>called a holy ſacrifice, and without spot</hi>) is offered vp: for the <hi>Catholicke Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond part of the <hi>Canon,</hi> beginning with <hi>Memento Domini.</hi> It is offered not conſecrate, <hi>for the redemption of ſoules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it is not conſecrate, it is manifeſt: for in the fift part of the <hi>Canon</hi> beginning with <hi>Quam oblatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> The vnder Prieſt deſireth, <hi>that it may be made the body and bloud of Chriſt:</hi> Neither are the words of conſecration, as they terme them, (namely, <hi>Hoc eſt enim corpus meum,</hi>) reade vntill the ſixt part of the <hi>Canon.</hi> Thus they bewraying themſelues, to be of the latter ſtanding, (by offering bread vnconſecrate, for the remiſſion of ſinnes) are <hi>heretiques:</hi> by <hi>Kel.</hi> cenſure. And cannot conſecrate, as the <hi>Maiſter</hi> of the <hi>Sentenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to conſider, what other things hinder the conſecration: which we can no better do, then by taking a view of their own Canon. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prieſt is commanded. <hi>To frame his whole mind and intent, to the croſſes and words. He is commanded alſo, to make choiſe of one Hoſt, and let it lye amongst the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13969:60"/> reſt alwaies prouided: and that his minde be vpon them all at once: He is moreouer commanded with one breath to speake theſe words. (Hoc est enim corpus meum) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking any other thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if the Prieſt do not ſpeake theſe words, <hi>cum intentione conſecrandi,</hi> that is: <hi>with an intent and minde to conſecrate,</hi> they be not made the body and bloud of Chriſt: but remaine ſtill <hi>nude, nude,</hi> and bare creatures of bread and wine.<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Therefore to auoide the errour of ſuch idolatry: The <hi>Maiſter</hi> of <hi>Sentences</hi> aduiſeth them to worſhip with a condition: ſaying, <hi>Lord if thou be there I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thee: If thou be not there I worſhip not.</hi> Whoſe counſell an Inquiſitor of <hi>Spaine</hi> following.

               </p>
               <p>In which matter of ambiguity, likewiſe the Prieſt (in the cantels of the Maſſe) is commanded, <hi>to take vp his owne Host before any other:</hi> becauſe, <hi>he beleeueth and is aſſured of his owne: howbeit he beleeueth of the reſt, but is not aſſured</hi> Moreouer, <hi>there muſt be great heed taken by the Prieſt, that a little water be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wine: For if there ſhould ſo much be put in, as to cauſe the wine to looſe his colour, the conſecration wereof none effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, we are to ſearch the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Page 386.</note> whether the bread may be conſecrated, and made a God, or no? <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſaith it may. <hi>For the ſacrifice of the Maſſe,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the ſacrifice, which Chriſt offered at his laſt Supper: when taking bread, and wine into his hands, he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13969:61"/> bleſſed them, and by bleſſing, turning them into his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred body and bloud: he told his Diſciples, that it was his body and bloud which he gaue for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Chriſt conſecrated the bread and wine when he bleſſed it, where are the wordes of conſecration? Seeing there is none named, but a teſtimony that he gaue <hi>thankes.</hi> If not when he bleſſed the bread? It is not like it was done after (as they would haue it) by vertue of theſe words: <hi>Hoc eſt enim corpus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> namely, after his Diſciples had receiued it, who being alwaies ready to obay the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, did take, when Chriſt commanded them to take, and did eate, when he commanded them to eate: which both went before he ſaid <hi>this is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be words of God nominated in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> wherby God made al the world. Yet though we haue the words of the <hi>Creation,</hi> a new <hi>creature</hi> we cannot make: much leſſe without words of conſecration, the Creator of all things. Who will not giue his glory to a creature: that is, he will not be made by a creature, a worke farre excelling all his workes for a man to make his <hi>Creator.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſay. 43.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things breifly conſidered, how can <hi>Kelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> proue: that Chriſt conſecrated the bread, when he changed not the ſubſtance but the vſe. Which created for a temporall life to feed the body, is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Omnipotency of the word (which is Chriſt) to feed the ſoule to eternall life.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.26 Luke 22.18</note> And that he changed not the ſubſtance, but the vſe, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, by the words of the Apoſtle, where it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led bread, after the words of conſecration, and the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13969:61"/> wine the bloud of grape. Both liuely repreſenting the death of our Sauiour (as the Annotation vpon the Rhems confeſſeth) <hi>The bread, the body of Chriſt, with the bloud poured out: the wine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22. annot. Iohn 6: annot.</note> 
                  <hi>the bloud powred or ſhed out of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Maſſe Prieſt, ſhould <hi>alwaies receiue both kinds, by their owne confeſſion: becauſe he muſt liuely expreſſe the paſſion of Chriſt, and the ſeparation of his bloud from his body:</hi> Which cannot be done by a round cake, or vnbloudy ſacrifice. For if it could he needed not both to conſecrate, and receiue bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>with what ſhew of truth, Chriſt would preferre it before Manna.

Then a man might haue euerlaſting life, without the eating of Chriſts fleſh, and drinking his bloud: which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſts expreſſe wordes:<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.53.</note> (who ſaith) <hi>Except you eate the fleſh of the Son of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you.</hi> Or elſe we muſt needs ſay: that a man eating may be ſaued, not beleeuing in Chriſt, which is contrary alſo to the written word: which ſaith. <hi>He that beleeueth not, is condemned already.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.18.</note> Therefore of neceſſity, to beleeue in Chriſt, and to eate him is al one. <hi>Crede &amp; manducaſti</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Aug.) Beleeue and thou haſt eaten.</hi>

               <p>Now that Chriſt is not preſent euery where:

               <p>Here it plainely appeareth, that Chriſt is not perſonally preſent, according to his humanity, euery where: for that is proper to the God-head of Chriſt.
